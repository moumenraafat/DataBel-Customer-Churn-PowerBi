# 📊 DataBel Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power Bi)

## 📌 Overview
This project features an interactive **Power Bi** Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize customer churn data of a Cellular network (DataBel). The primary goal is to identify why customers are leaving and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides deep dives into demographics, contract types, and geographic patterns..


## 📂 Dataset Details
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing customer-level information:
* **Customer ID:** Unique identifier for each client.
* **Demographics:** Age, Senior Citizen status, Under 30 status, etc.
* **Account Info:** Contract types (Monthly vs. Yearly) and billing details.
* **Churn Status:** Churn Label (Yes/No).
* **Churn Drivers:** Specific reasons for leaving (e.g., Competitor, Price, Dissatisfaction).
* **Geography:** State-level distribution.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **KPI Cards:** Instant visibility into Total Customers, Churned Customers, and Churn Rate %.
